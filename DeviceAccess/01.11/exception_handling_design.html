<h1><a class="anchor" id="gen_idea"></a>
General Idea</h1>
<p>Exceptions must be handled by ApplicationCore in a way that the application developer does not have to care much about it.</p>
<p>In case of a runtime_error exception the framework must catch the expection and report it to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a>. The <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> handles this exception and preiodically tries to open the device. In case of several devices only the faulty device is blocked. Even if a device is faulty it should not block the server from starting.</p>
<p>If an input variable is in the error state, it sets the DataValidity flag for its DataValidityProparationExecutor (see <a class="el" href="spec_data_validity_propagation.html">spec_dataValidityPropagation</a>) to faulty and the flag is propogated appropriately. After the exception is cleared and operation returns without a data fault flag, set DataValidity flag to ok. Furthermore, the device must be reinitialised automatically and also recover the values of process variables as the device might have rebooted and the variables have been re-set.</p>
<p><b>1. Genesis</b></p><ul>
<li>a (removed)</li>
<li>b. An initailisation handler can be added to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> in the user code. Initialisation handlers are callback function which will be executed when a device is opened for the first time and after a device recovers from an exception, before any process variables are written.</li>
<li>c. Initial values must be correctly propogated after a device is opened. See <a class="el" href="spec_initial_value_propagation.html">spec_initialValuePropagation</a>. Especially, no read function (even readNonBlocking/readLatest) must return before an initial value has been received.</li>
<li>d. (removed)</li>
<li>e. An <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> is placed around all NDRegisterAccessors which connect a device to a <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a> or fanout. (*)</li>
<li>f. (removed)</li>
<li>g. By default a recovery accessor is added for each device register when it is obtianed. These recovery accessors are used to correctly set the values of variables when the device is opened for the first time and after a device is recovered from an exception. (*)</li>
<li>h. An <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> for an input knows its DataValidityProparationExecutor, which lives in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a> or fanout that reads the input. Like this it can propagate the dataValidity flag. Outputs do not send DataValidity faulty in case of exceptions (see <a class="el" href="spec_data_validity_propagation.html">spec_dataValidityPropagation</a>).</li>
<li>i. Write should not block in case of an exception for the outputs of <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_threaded_fan_out.html" title="FanOut implementation with an internal thread which waits for new data which is read from the given f...">ThreadedFanOut</a> / <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_trigger_fan_out.html" title="InternalModule which waits for a trigger, then reads a number of variables and distributes each of th...">TriggerFanOut</a>. (*)</li>
<li>j. Exception handling and invalid flag propagation has to be implemented such that it is transparent to a module whether it is directly connected to a device, or whether a fanout or another application module is in between.</li>
<li>k. The server must start even if some devices are in error state. The devices which are working and all modules that do not talk to the broken device must work.</li>
<li>l. After a device has been re-opened, all values that had once been written must be re-written.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. The Flow</b></p>
<ul>
<li>2.1. The application always starts with all devices as closed and intial value for deviceError.status is set to 1. The <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> takes care that ExceptionHandlingDecorators do not perform any read or write operations, but block. This must happen before running any prepare() of an <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a>, where the first write calls to ExceptionHandlingDecorators are done.</li>
<li>2.2 In <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_module.html#af2807dcc289719688b513e05ca6f1568" title="Prepare the execution of the module. ">ApplicationModule::prepare()</a> some initial values (and constants) are written. As the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> must not perform the actual write at this point, it will put the value into the dataRecoveryAccesssor and report an exception to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a>.<ul>
<li>2.2.3 Although <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a> and fanout threads start after the device module threads, the application is now asyncronous and read or write operations can already take place in the main loops, even if the device is not ready yet (it might actually be broken). All read and write operations are blocked buy the exceptionHandlingDecorators at this point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.3 The device module thread starts.<ul>
<li>2.3.1 The <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> tries to open the device until it succeeds.(*)</li>
<li>2.3.2 Device is initailised by iterating initialisationHandlers list. If there is an exception go back to 2.3.1. (*)</li>
<li>2.3.3 The list of reported exceptions is cleared. (*)</li>
<li>2.3.4 All valid (*) recovery accessors are written. If there is an exception go back to 2.3.1. (*)</li>
<li>2.3.5 deviceError.status is set to 0.</li>
<li>2.3.6 <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> allows that ExceptionHandlingDecorators execute reads and writes.</li>
<li>2.3.7 All blocked read and write operations (from 2.5.3) are notified.(*)</li>
<li>2.3.8 The DeviceModuleThread waits for the next reported exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4 Device and <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application.html">Application</a> are running normally<ul>
<li>2.4.1 All blocked ExceptionHandlingDecorators continue (*)<ul>
<li>2.4.1.1 write just continues (recovery accessor has done the write)</li>
<li>2.4.1.2 read/readNonBlocking/readLatest<ul>
<li>2.4.1.2.1 tells the DataValidityPropagationExecutor that the device error has gone</li>
<li>2.4.1.2.2 (re-)tries to get the value. In case of an exception go to 2.5</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4.2 In the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a>, all write calls always fill the value into the recovery accessors before trying to execute the real write. Like this, the recovery accessor always has the last value that should have been written to the device. All recovery accessors become valid over time (see comment for 2.3.4).<ul>
<li>2.4.2.1 If a write is not executed because the device is already faulty (from 2.2 or 2.6.1), the recovery accessor has to take care of this. In this case we always have to send another exception notification to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> to make sure that the new recovery value is not missed (avoid race condition). (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.5. When a read / write operation on the device (1.e) causes a runtime_error exception, the exception is caught in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a><ul>
<li>2.5.1. If it is a read operation the DataValidityPropagationExecutor is informed that there was a device error. (*)</li>
<li>2.5.2. The error is reported to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a></li>
<li>2.5.3. Action depending on the calling operation :<ul>
<li>write : blocks until the device is recovered.</li>
<li>read : If the accessor has aleady seen its initial value, the first "blocking" read call returns immediately (remember DataValidity is set to faulty). The <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> remembers that it is in an exception state. The calling module thread will continue and propagate the data invalid flag. The second call will finally block. If there has not been an initial value yet, even the first call will block until it is available.</li>
<li>readNonBlocking / readLatest: will always return with data invalid flag (unless there has not been an initial value yet).</li>
<li>writeWithoutErrorBlocking: just returns (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.6 The exception is received in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> thread<ul>
<li>2.6.1 deviceError.status will be set to 1. From this point on, all ExceptionHandlingDecorators for this device must block all read and write operations (see also 2.2 and 2.3.6).</li>
<li>2.6.2 The thread goes back to 2.2.1 and tries to re-open the device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. (*) Comments</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1.e. In addition there can be recovery accesors for the same variables, which are not decorated. They are not directly seen by the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a> and the fanouts.</li>
<li>1.g. Output accessors can have the option not to have a recovery accessor. This is needed for instance for "trigger registers" which start an operation on the hardware. Also void registers don't have recovery accessors.</li>
<li>1.i. The specification for initial value propagation (<a class="el" href="spec_initial_value_propagation.html">spec_initialValuePropagation</a>) also says that writes ApplicationModules don't block before the first successful read in the main loop.</li>
<li>2.3.1 Successul opening includes that the device reports isFunctional() as true.</li>
<li>2.3.2 and 2.3.4 Exceptions for re-initialisation and recovery will be reported once, but not if it occurs again before the device has completely recovered.</li>
<li>2.3.3 ExceptionHandlingDecorators must always first write the recovery accessor, then report an exception. As the device module clears the exceptions first, then processes the accessors, it is guaranteed that no value is missed. As a side effect it can be that a pending exception triggers an unnecessary recovery loop in the device module.</li>
<li>2.3.4 If a recovery accessors has not seen an initial value yet, it will not be written (see <a class="el" href="spec_initial_value_propagation.html">spec_initialValuePropagation</a>).</li>
<li>2.3.7 This is different from 2.2.6 because 2.2.6 affects accessors which want to perform a read or write, while 2.2.7 affects accessors that failed to do so and are waiting for the device to become available again. This is needed for two cases:<ul>
<li>1. A blocking write, where the recovery accessor has already done the job when the device if back to OK.</li>
<li>2. The first blocking read if the data has not seen the initial value yet, and retrieving it casued the exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4.1 writeWithoutErrorBlocking is not mentioned because it never blocks. Although blocked by different mechanisms read/readNonBlocking/readLatest behave the same:<ul>
<li>read is either the second read call which is expected to deliver the next value, or any of the three are still waiting for the initial value. In any case they have to (re-)try reading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.4.2.1 Basically after each update of the recovery accessor there has to be a valid write, or an exception has to be reported to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a>, to make sure the value is seen by the device (unless the recovery accessor is updated before this happens).</li>
<li>2.5.1 incrementDataInvalidCounter() is called. See <a class="el" href="spec_data_validity_propagation.html">spec_dataValidityPropagation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Asyncronous read</b></p><ul>
<li>The transfer future in readAsync() behaves like the normal read:<ul>
<li>The first call to hasNewData() returns true if an error occured in the read transfer. <code>wait()</code> will return immediately with DataVality::faulty.</li>
<li>The second call to hasNewData() will return false until the device has recovered and there actually is new data. <code>wait()</code> will bock until then.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="exception_handling_implmentation"></a>
Implementation</h1>
<p><b>3. DeviceAccess</b></p>
<p>Requirements to the DeviceAccess interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.1 Exceptions are only reported in doPostRead()/doPostWrite()<ul>
<li>As the error itself always occurs in the read/write transfer, the TransferElement base class implements a mechanism to catch it and transfer the exception message into the post-read function, where it is re-thrown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is required for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. A tranfer must always be complete, i.e. preXxx and postXxx must always be called. This is for instance important in case a user buffer has been swapped out, and has to be swapped back in so the user buffer stays intact in the application. Letting the exception in doXxxTransfer through would break this. (This is DeviceAcces spec.)</li>
<li>2. The transfer groups calls doXxxTransfer itself on a potentially exchanged hardware accessing element. All code using transfer groups would have to do exception handling itself, and the individual accessors would not behave according to this (ApplicationCore excetion handling) specification when used with a transfer group. By throwing in doPostXxx the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> can handle it, and it automatically works with transfer groups.</li>
<li>3. Asyncronous reads are executing the transfer in a different thread anyway, and have to delay the throwing to postRead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before throwing, each backend must make sure that the actions in doPostRead() are completed such that the user buffer of a calling accessor is intact</p><ul>
<li>postRead() and postWrite() take care that the bookkeeping of ongoing transfers is done correctly, even if the called doPostXxx actions throw.</li>

<li>4.2.5 A shared mutext to protect the covery accessors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.2.1 A user/application can also report device errors calling DeviceModue::reportException(). This allows to for instance to write a watchdog module which is monitoring a reference regsiter, and puts the whole device into an exception state (incl. automatic message to the CS, propagation of the DataValidity::faulty flag and recovery).</li>
<li>4.2.2 Currently implemented as a condition variable</li>
<li>4.2.3 Read/write operations must hold a shared lock before executing the actual read/write. This is implemented in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a>. As the lock is shared, parallel write operations don't block each other inside application core. While recovering, the device module will hold an exclusive lock.</li>
<li>4.2.5 As the recovery accessors are filled in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a> threads (or fanouts), but the writing is taking place in the device module thread, the recovery accessor's user buffer must be protected with a mutex. Again, a shared mutex is used so normal write operations can run in parallel and don't interfere with each other (each one only touches its own buffer), and the write, which touches all buffers holds an exlusive lock.</li>

<p>To make sure that the server always starts, even if some or all devices are in error state, the initial opening of the device takes place in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> thread (inside the exception handling loop). The device module reports its status and error messages to the control system (see 2.1, 2.3.5, 2.6.1).</p>
<p>Some initial values are already written in prepare(), before the threads are started. Writing these values must be delayed until the device is available. This is done by the same mechanism that is used to re-write the values after recovery. (see 10 and <a class="el" href="spec_initial_value_propagation.html">spec_initialValuePropagation</a>)</p>
<p><b>8. Propogating the DataValidity flag</b></p>
<p>If a device is in error state, all it's output data is marked as invalid. This invalid flag shall be propagated through the connected modules such that all data that is calculated from these invalid values is also marked invalid (see <a class="el" href="spec_data_validity_propagation.html">spec_dataValidityPropagation</a>). The <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> is informing the DataValidityPropagationExecutor about the device state (error or ok, see 3.6.3 and 2.4.1.2.1)</p>
<p>To propagate the flag, the first blocking read after the device error return the last value. As the DataValidityPropagationExecutor knows about the device error, the data invalid flag is turned on (2.5.3-read). In order not to prevent unnecessary running of modules with invalid data, the following read call blocks until the device has recovered.</p>
<p>After recovery the DataValidityPropagationExecutor is informed that the device is OK again, and the received DataValidity of the variable is propagated (usually 'ok', but if 'faulty' is reveived, the data validity stays faulty).</p>
<p><b>9. Device initialisation </b></p>
<p>This partly is specification of the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a>. As it is strongly connected with exception handling, and in fact handled by the same code, it is mentioned here.</p>
<ul>
<li>9.1 The user code can register exception handlers (in the constructor of the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> or using <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html#ab30bf1b235913143d45bb5da7d84052c" title="Add initialisation handlers to the device. ">DeviceModule::addInitialisationHandler</a>). They are executed each time after the device has successfully been opneded (*)</li>
<li>9.2 Sometimes it is only possible to write parts of the device after a proper initialisation sequence (for instance reset-registers must be cleared, or comminication clocks to sub-devices must be set). Hence no read or write operations must take place until this point, not even writing recovery accessors (implementes 1.c, implemented by 4.2.3, 5.3.1.2 and 5.3.2.1).</li>
<li>9.3 The recovery accessors are written after the initialisation (implements 1.l).</li>
<li>9.4 The lock 4.2.3 is only released after all recovery accessors are written, so ApplicationsModules which continue find the same state as before the error when writing or reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments:</p><ul>
<li>9.1 Successfully opened means open() did not throw, and the device reports isFunctional() as true.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>10. Recover accessors</b></p>
<p>After a device has failed and recovered, it might have re-booted and lost the values of the process variables that live in the server and are written to the device. Hence these values have to be re-written after the device has recovered. The same holds for initial values which have been written before the device thread has started (see 7.), and even normal variables which have been written before the device is available, as several threads start asynchronously.</p>
<p>The writing after the recovery is done in the device thread. The regular register accessors (which are decorated with the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a>) belong to the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a> threads (or those of the fanouts), which can modify the user buffer any time. Hence the device thread cannot use these accessors in a thread-safe way. In addition, the device module has to remember the last value which has been written to restore a consistent state. The <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application_module.html">ApplicationModule</a> might already have modified it's user buffer, but not have written yet. Hence also for logical reasons this buffer cannot be used for recovery.</p>
<p>As a consequence a copy has to be created whenever the data is written to the device. It is implemented by a so called recovery accessor. This is a regular second accessor to the register whos accessor has been decorated with the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a>, but with the special usage that the data is set in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_application.html">Application</a> thread, and written in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>10.1 The recovery accessor is created together with the normal accessor in the connection code (in <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html#accf9d83766a0503e4118aeeae0aec36e" title="List of TransferElements to be written after the device has been recovered. ">DeviceModule::writeRecoveryOpen</a>), registered at the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> and given to the recovery accessors.</li>
<li>10.2 Data is copied in doPreWrite(), before the original accessor's pre-write is called. This is the last occasion where the data is still guarateed to be in the original accessors's user buffer. The accessor's pre-write might swap the data out, and it might never be available again (in case of write desrictively.</li>
<li>10.3 As the user buffer recovery accessor is written in an AppicationModule or fanout thread, but read in the <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a> thread when recovering, it has to be protected by a mutex. For efficiency one single shared mutex is used. All ExceptionHandlingDecorators will accquire a shared lock, as each decorator only touches his own buffer. The <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_device_module.html" title="Implementes access to a ChimeraTK::Device. ">DeviceModule</a>, which writes all recovery accessors, uses the unique lock to prevent any <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_exception_handling_decorator.html" title="Decorator of the NDRegisterAccessor which facilitates tests of the application. ">ExceptionHandlingDecorator</a> to modify the user buffer while doing so.</li>
<li>10.4 All valid recovery accessors are written each time the device has been (re)-opened, after the initialisation handlers have been executed. If a recovery accessor has not seen an initial value yet, the version number is still nullptr, and the accessor is invalid. These accessors are not written. (implements 1.l)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>11. Known Issues</b></p>
<ul>
<li>11.1 In step 2.1: The intial value of deviceError is not set to 1.</li>
<li>11.2 In step 2.2.3: is not correctly fulfilled as we are only waiting for device to be opened and don't wait for it to be correctly initialised. The lock 4.2.3 is not implemented at all.</li>
<li>11.3 In step 2.3.5: is currently being set before initialisationHandlers and writeAfterOpen.</li>
<li>11.4 Check the documentation of DataValidity. ...'Note that if the data is distributed through a triggered <a class="el" href="class_chimera_t_k_1_1_fan_out.html" title="Base class for several implementations which distribute values from one feeder to multiple consumers...">FanOut</a>....'</li>
<li>11.5 Data validity is currently propagated through the "owner", which conceptually does not always work. A DataValidityPropagationExecutor needs to be introduced and used at the correct places.</li>
<li>11.6 In comment to 1.g: recovery accessors are not optional at the moment.</li>
<li>11.7 In 1.c: Currently data is transported even if the "value after construction" is still in.</li>
<li>11.8 In 1.i, 6: ThreadedFanout and TriggerFanout do not use non-blocking write because it does not exist yet</li>
<li>11.9 In 1.j, 2.5.3: Not implemented like that. The first read blocks, and a special mechanism to propagate the flags is triggered only in the next module.</li>
<li>11.10 In 2.3: The device module has a special "first opening" sequence. This is not necessary any more. The "writeAfterOpen" list is obsolete. You can always use the recovery accessors.</li>
<li>11.11 In 2.3.4: Recovery accessors are always written. It is not checked whether there is valid data (not "value after construction")</li>
<li>11.12 In 2.4.1.1: Write probably re-executed after recovery. This should not happen because the recovery accessor has already done it.</li>
<li>11.13 In 2.5.3: The non-blocking read functions always block on exceptions. They should not (only if there is no initial value).</li>
<li>11.14 In 2.5.2, 5.1: writeWithoutErrorBlocking is not implemented yet</li>
<li>11.15 Asyncronous reads are not working with the current implementation, incl. readAny.</li>
<li>11.16 In 3: DeviceAccess : RegisterAccessors throw in doReadTransfer now.</li>
<li>11.17 In 4.2.1: reportException does block (should not)</li>
<li>11.18 In 4.2.2: blocking wait function does not exist (not needed in current implementation as reportException blocks)</li>
<li>11.19 In 5.2.1: Exceptions are caught in doXxxTransfer instead of doPostXxx.</li>
<li>11.20 In 5.3.1.2, 5.3.2.1: Decoration of doXxxTransfer does not accquire the lock (which does not even exist yet, see 4.2.3) </li>
